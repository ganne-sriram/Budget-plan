Description:
This project leverages Power BI to develop a detailed budget plan for BSC Company, focusing on revenue analysis and forecasting. It involves variance analysis of historical revenue data from 2017 to 2019 to identify key trends and performance drivers. Using Power BI's advanced visualization capabilities, a comprehensive baseline budget for 2020-2022 was created, with monthly projections for the first year and annual projections for the following years.

Key findings highlight the electronics category as the highest revenue generator and significant revenue variances in the Northwest and South regions. The project proposes growth scenarios with 5%, 10%, and 15% additional annual growth rates above the baseline, targeting high-revenue subcategories like "Science and Technology" books and "Video Equipment" electronics. It also introduces new products such as tablets and loudspeakers to drive market expansion. Power BI was instrumental in visualizing these scenarios and their impact on revenue through interactive dashboards and reports, providing clear and actionable recommendations for achieving BSC’s growth targets.
